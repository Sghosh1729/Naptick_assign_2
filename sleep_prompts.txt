Question: What is The combination of topological data analysis and mathematical modeling improves sleep stage prediction from consumer-grade wearables?
Answer: 
  What is the problem being addressed?  Wearable devices are promising tools for simplifying complex process of sleep stage classification. However, the data collected from wearable devices are highly noisy, multidimensional, and nonlinear, resulting in limited accuracy for sleep scoring. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve the performance of wearable-based sleep scoring algorithms by effectively processing complex wearable data with computational tools.

Question: What is Profiling Sleep Architecture using a seven-state continuous-time Markov model ?
Answer: 
  Sleep is a complex biological process regulated by networks of neurons and environmental factors. As one falls asleep, neurotransmitters from sleep–wake regulating neurons work in synergy to control the switching of different sleep states throughout the night. As sleep disorders or underlying neuropathology can manifest as irregular switching, analyzing these patterns is crucial in sleep medicine and neuroscience.

Question: What is Performance of an open machine learning model to classify sleep/wake from actigraphy across ∼24-hour intervals without knowledge of rest timing?
Answer: 
  What is the problem being addressed?  Commonly used sleep-wake algorithms for wrist actigraphy tend to overclassify sleep, relative to wake. This overclassification is most evident when wrist actigraphy includes data from outside of an ‘in-bed’ (or ‘rest’) interval, as is the case for longitudinal studies of participants in free-living scenarios.
